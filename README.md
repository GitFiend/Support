# GitFiend Support

Website: https://gitfiend.com

This is a Public repo for GitFiend questions and issues. I usually check this once a day.

I especially want to hear if you encounter bugs, usability issues or you think GitFiend is missing deal-breaking features.

I prefer hearing problems rather than solutions as GitFiend is deliberately not trying to follow in the footsteps of other Git clients.

Note: This repo doesn't contain the source code for GitFiend.
