# GitFiend

This is the root repo for [GitFiend](https://gitfiend.com).
It contains the source and the tooling to build and package GitFiend. Contains 2 other repos as submodules:

- [gitfiend-shell](https://github.com/GitFiend/gitfiend-shell): The app main process and window. Contains scripts to build and package everything.

- [gitfiend-core](https://github.com/GitFiend/gitfiend-core):
  The backend/core of GitFiend. Reads git repos and handles data requests and actions.

The frontend code is included in gitfiend-shell, but minified for now.
